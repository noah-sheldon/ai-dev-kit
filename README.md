## What Is This?

AI Dev Kit is a **complete plugin-oriented developer workspace** for AI coding assistants. It ships everything needed to run professional-grade engineering workflows — TDD, code review, security audit, CI/CD, ML pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, code quality analysis, and debt tracking — across Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Gemini CLI.

Think of it as a **system prompt that scales to 59 specialized skills and 33 domain agents**, with lifecycle hooks and automated validation.

---

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add noah-sheldon/ai-dev-kit
/plugin install ai-dev-kit@ai-dev-kit

### Codex

Restart Codex after cloning this repo. The marketplace at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` will be discovered automatically.

### OpenCode

```bash
cd .opencode/plugins && npm install && npm run build
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions link .
```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add noah-sheldon/ai-dev-kit
copilot plugin install ai-dev-kit@ai-dev-kit
```

Or install directly from the repo:

```bash
copilot plugin install noah-sheldon/ai-dev-kit:.github-copilot
```

### Qwen Code

```bash
qwen extensions install noah-sheldon/ai-dev-kit
```

Or install locally:

## Core Principles

1. **Agent-first** — delegate domain work to the right specialist.
2. **Test-driven** — write tests before implementation when behavior changes.
3. **Security-first** — validate inputs, avoid unsafe defaults, never hardcode secrets.
4. **Plan-before-execute** — break complex work into phases with the planner.
5. **Model fallback** — if a requested model is unavailable, use the default and continue.

---

## Workflow

```
Request → Planner → Architect → Domain Agents → AI-Judge → Implementation → Code Review → Security Review → Merge
```

1. **Plan** complex work with the `planner` agent before touching code.
2. **Write tests** first — use `tdd-guide` for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR discipline.
3. **Implement** with domain specialists (python-reviewer, ml-engineer, etc.).
4. **Validate** with `ai-judge` — rubric covers completeness, correctness, security, feasibility, testability.
5. **Review** with `code-reviewer` and `security-reviewer` before merge.
6. **Ship** with `git-agent-coordinator` for clean branch management.

## MCP Servers (Optional)

MCP servers are **not bundled** with this kit to avoid corporate network/proxy issues. Add your own MCP servers as needed:

| Server | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `github` | GitHub API access, PR management |
| `context7` | Live documentation lookup |
| `exa` | Neural web search |
| `memory` | Persistent memory across sessions |
| `playwright` | Browser automation & E2E testing |
| `sequential-thinking` | Step-by-step reasoning |

Configure MCP servers in your own `.mcp.json` at the project root.

---

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** v2.1+ (hooks auto-load by convention)
- **Node.js** 24+ LTS (for scripts and validation)
- **Git** (for agent coordination and version control)

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I adapt this for my project?**
Start from `docs/examples/project-guidelines-template.md` and customize the skills you need.

**Q: What if a model is unavailable?**
Every agent has a `fallback_model` setting. If the specified model is down, it falls back to the workspace default.

**Q: How do I validate everything is correct?**
```bash
npm test                    # smoke tests
node scripts/validate-surface.js  # production surface check
```

**Q: Can I install only certain skills?**
Yes — the kit supports selective install. Each skill is self-contained. Copy only what you need.

**Q: How do I contribute?**
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Run `npm test` before submitting.

## Security

- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables or secret managers.
- Validate all external input at boundaries.
- Prefer least privilege and explicit allowlists.
- Review any change touching auth, secrets, or shell execution with `security-reviewer`.

See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the full policy.
